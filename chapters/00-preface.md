### Preface

The Preface will explain to the reader how and why the LESS language came to be, why the language is exciting to use, why they should read the rest of the book, and why a book this book about "Learning LESS" was written.

Then we will briefly review the following topics:

* A history of LESS
* Why LESS, why not something else?
* What you will learn from this book, and who should read it
* A summary of each chapter
* What to expect by the end of the book
* An explanation of the coding, formatting and style conventions used throughout the book.

Last, we will look at examples of complex UI designs, components and component libraries to demonstrate how powerful LESS can be as a development language. Then we will wrap up with a preview of the language features of LESS that we will be discussing, along with the corresponding user-interface components that the reader and I will be constructing together throughout the remainder of the book.
