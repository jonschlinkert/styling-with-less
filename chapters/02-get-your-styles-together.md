###  Chapter 2: Get Your Styles Together! LESS keeps you organized.

In this chapter, I will introduce the reader to actual features of LESS, focusing on features that are useful for organizing styles and stylesheets. These same features are also responsible for attracting many developers to the language.

**Topics discussed**:

* Nesting styles makes code more readable
* Nesting too much makes code less readable
* @import Statements in LESS versus CSS
* Code comments: block and inline styles
* Strategies for converting CSS to LESS, or refactoring old code
* Design Patterns, Coding Conventions and Best Practices
