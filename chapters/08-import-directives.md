### Chapter 8: Import Directives

To demonstrate the power of import directives, in this chapter we will create a "micro-theme" for a previous created component.

Import directives give the developer a great deal of control over how the Less.js parser processes `@import` statements. So this chapter will leverage features discussed in previous chapters to demonstrate how import directives can, for example, enable implementing multiple themes for a single UI component while only rendering the CSS for the theme or themes required.

**Topics discussed**:

* External Mixin Libraries
* Using Frameworks as "style wells"
* `@import` Directives
* `@import (once)`
* `@import (multiple)`
* `@import (less)`
* `@import (css)`
* `@import (reference)`
* Importing from inside mixins or rule sets
