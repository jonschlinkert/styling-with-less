### Chapter 3: Variables

In this chapter, we will use variables to construct a typography component.

Variables make it easier to maintain and control values for things like palette and typography, by keeping those values in one place. So the chapter will review how basic variables work, and then we will briefly discuss a number of different potential applications and creative uses for variables.

**Topics discussed**:

* Basic variables: Make Less.js do the math
* Escaping
* Scope
* String interpolation
* Selector interpolation
* Media queries as variables
* Variable variable names (duplicate word intentional)
* Differences from other precompilers
* Proposals for native CSS variables
