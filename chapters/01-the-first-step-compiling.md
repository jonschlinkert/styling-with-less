### Chapter 1: Take the First Step: Get Comfortable with Compiling.

In this chapter we will discuss what LESS can do for developers, teams and developer-workflows. We will touch on how LESS empowers third-party frameworks, how to use LESS in the browser, how to compile using third-party command line and GUI build systems.

**Topics discussed**:

* Improving developer workflows
* Compiling with the command line and Less.js ("lessc")
* Compiling with Node.js and  Grunt.js
* Compiling LESS in the browser
* Watch mode, "env" and "Live refresh"
* Why the core team recommends against compiling in the browser.
