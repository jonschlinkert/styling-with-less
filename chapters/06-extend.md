### Chapter 6: Extend: Selector Inheritance

In this chapter, since we will construct a complex UI component such as a modal dialog or a dropdown- menu.

The extend feature offers ways to reduce code footprint, so the advantages of using this feature will be most prevalent and obvious when implementing styles that are complex or potentially repetitious such as gradients and transitions.

**Topics discussed**:

* Selector Inheritance versus the Cascade. When to extend, and when to mix-in.
* Extend Directives
    - :extend(all)
    - :extend(any)
* Chaining
* Extending Mixins (in anticipation of the release of this feature)
* How the LESS implementation of `:extend` differs from other pre-processors
