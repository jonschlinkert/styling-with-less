### Chapter 5: Mixins

In this chapter we will construct a small mixin library.

Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be applied throughout your stylesheets, and even modified when necessary. Thus, mixins make it easy for developers to generate complex styles that render consistently across browsers.

To help the reader understand how mixins work, and how they can be applied in the real world, the mixins we add to our library can not only be used with the other components we create in this book, but also with other projects. Additionally, each mixin will also build upon the operations and variables features discussed in previous chapters.

**Topics discussed**:

* Code reuse
* Implicit mixins
* Parametric mixins
* Nested mixins
* Compound mixins
* Mixins with return values
* Mixin-name interpolation (in anticipation of the release of this feature)
* Namespaces
* Utility Classes
