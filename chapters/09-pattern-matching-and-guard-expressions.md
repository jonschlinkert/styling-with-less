### Chapter 9: Pattern Matching and Guard Expressions

In this chapter, we will construct a basic CSS grid system that has a variable number of columns, so that the reader may customize it to meet his or her needs.

Pattern matching is used to change the behavior (output) of mixins, and the patterns matched against are either the arity of the mixins' arguments or the parameters passed to the mixins. Guard expressions are a basic form of "if statement" used for matching against expressions. Guard expressions and pattern matching together are often leveraged to create dynamic grid systems or to enable complex, end-user- generated themes.

**Topics discussed**:

* Arity: how to make mixins even more dynamic
* The "when" keyword
* Looping with guard statements
* Structural CSS, layouts, containers and "clearfix"
* Grid rows
