### Chapter 4: Operations and Functions

In this chapter we will construct a palette component, or color scheme, using math operations and variables. Operations make variables much more powerful, and they pave the way for mixins, which will be discussed in the next chapter.  Operations are useful for calculating values "on-the-fly", so we will see in this chapter that operations can be used for generating multiple matching color variations or "modifier"values based off of a single color value. 


**Topics discussed**:

* Math Evaluation (`strictMaths`)
* Unit evaluation (`strictUnits`)
* Boolean Operations
* Color Operations
* String Functions
* Math Functions
* Miscellaneous Functions
* CSS `calc()`,  and how LESS operations differ.
